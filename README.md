# Forecasting CPI for All Urban Consumers: Apparel in U.S. City Average

## Abstract
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change overtime in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. This dataset is specifically for a market basket of apparel items for all urban consumers (CPI-U) in the U.S city average from 1990 to 2019.  Using this data set, our goal is to forecast the CPI-U for apparel 12 months into the future using Box-Jenkings methodology and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models. Forecasting these values will help us gain a better understanding in the fluctuations of CPI in apparel due to inflation and also seasonal changes.
